# VCK190 Base TRD

The Versal Base TRD consists of a series of platforms, accelerators and Jupyter
notebooks targeting the VCK190 evaluation board. A platform is a Vivado design
with a pre-instantiated set of I/O interfaces and a corresponding PetaLinux BSP
and image that includes the required kernel drivers and user-space libraries to
exercise those interfaces. Accelerators are mapped to FPGA logic resources
and/or AI Engine cores and stitched into the platform using the Vitis toolchain.
